Oh Peggy Gordon you are my darling
Come sit you down upon my knee
And give to me the very reason
Why I am slighted so by thee

I'm so in love I cannot stand it
My heart lies smothered in my breast
But it's not for you to let the world know it
A troubled heard can know no rest

I put my head to a cask of brandy
Sure 'tis my fancy I do declare
But when I'm drinkin', I'm always thinkin'
And wishing Peggy Gordon was near

I wish I was in some lonesome valley
Where woman kind cannot be found
And where all the small birds change their voices
And every day a different sound

Oh Peggy Gordon you are my darling
Come sit you down upon my knee
And give to me the very reason
Why I am slighted so by thee
